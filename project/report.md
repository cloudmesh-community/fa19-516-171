# Abstract Streaming interfaces for the NIST Big data Architecture

Jagadeesh Kandimalla, fa19-516-171 :o2:

:o2: Original title proposal was "Ingest Live Streaming Data/Replicating Database using Logs" whcih is too limited and does not showcase applicability on multiple clouds. However, this is easy to fix by developing a "register" like specification in OpenAPI just as we did for databases in the NIST document. YOu will have to look at 2 cloud providers to derive some common features. You could even describe how to much such dat between clouds. There are APIs and services that doe this. Provide a survey.

:o2: I like the idea of the queue, but you need to move forward, with an architecture diagram and code as well as potential tests to do this

# Objective

We will be ingesting data in real-time using AWS Services and Parse the data and load it in to database in abstract format/detailed(depending on the log which we are ingesting) for future processing.
CloudMesh will have a API which will subscribe to any realtime data and publish in the database by parsing.The Streaming may happen from On-premises to Cloud or in Cloud to Cloud , 
The steaming data can be anything if we choose photos as an example whenever the user uploads a photo in S3, 
and S3 events will trigger a message to send the photo to Queue the Queue will transfer it to the Database .
