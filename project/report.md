The AWSS3 Storage Provider interacts with Cloudmesh Shell and The
Storage functions of the provider are available through Cloudmesh
command line. The documentation related the the Storage provider can be
been in the below documentation link.

* Documentation: <https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/storage/storage.html>

The functions and the arguments given to the functions are explained in
this API documentation.

* API: <https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/api/cloudmesh.storage.provider.awss3.html>

The code should always be referred on the cloudmesh-storage module in
the master branch

* Code: <https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-storage/tree/master/cloudmesh/storage>

## Objective

The Objective was to completely fix the AWSS3 provider and create new
functions wherever needed(like Bucket exists and Bucket Create) and
fix/create Pytests for storage and file sizes. Size Pytests are used for
benchmarking the functions with different size input files.

## Technologies


* AWS S3(Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage
  service that that offers industry-leading scalability, data
  availability, security, and performance.)

* OpenAPI 3.0.2(An OPENAPI is an publicly available API that provides
  developers with Programmatic access to proprietary software
  application or web service)

* Python

There are some additional functions available for other Storage
Providers which can be found in the below link.


* <https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-manual/blob/master/docs-source/source/manual/storage.rst>


The code is available in 

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-storage/tree/master/cloudmesh/storage>

In the Storage Provider directory both  for awss3 and local provider new code have been changed 
and existing code is modified.


The AWS Account creation is documented in 

* <https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/accounts/aws.html>

The complete documentation and YAML file update we should do is in

* <https://cloudmesh.github.io/cloudmesh-manual/storage/storage.html>

The Pytests related to Awss3 and local are in 

* <https://github.com/cloudmesh/cloudmesh-storage/tree/master/tests>

The Pytests which should be run in the code are

```
test_storage.py  
test_storage_local.py  
test_storage_size.py 
```
